Download both the BackupLostLegacyTextures.py script and texturelist.txt and put them in the same folder as  Lost Legacy.
Python required to run the script: https://www.python.org/downloads/

This script is for backing up landscape and exterior architecture textures for the purpose of downsizing them with [Cathedral Assets Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316) to get better performance/less stutters in Skyrim Lost Legacy. If performance options in MO2 don't work well enoough for you, then downsizing these textures might help as it reduces RAM & VRAM usage. I only included 2K width/height and larger textures in the list.

You should disable performance mode options in MO2 if you use downsized textures to avoid overwriting some of them. After downsizing just replace the original files with them, don't do it through Mod Organizer. If you want to revert to original Lost Legacy textures, just replace them with the files backed up by this script.

In Cathedral Assets Optimizer: select the folder this script backed up > Tick all boxes under the textures tab > 2x2 ratio > Run (it takes a pretty long time to complete)

After using 'Cathedral Assets Optimizer' remember to also archive/zip those textures to back them up and not accidentally lose them.

Made for Lost Legacy version 1.2.0
