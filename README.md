This script is for backing up landscape and exterior architecture textures for the purpose of downsizing them with 'Cathedral Assets Optimizer' to get better performance/less stutters in Skyrim Lost Legacy. If performance options in MO2 don't work well enoough for you, then downsizing these textures might help as it reduces RAM & VRAM usage.

You should disable performance mode options in MO2 if you use downsized textures to avoid overwriting some of them. Just replace the original files with the downsized ones, don't do
it through Mod Organizer. If you want to revert to original Lost Legacy textures, then just replace them with the files backed up by this script.

After using 'Cathedral Assets Optimizer' remember to also archive/zip those textures to back them up and not accidentally lose them.

Made for Lost Legacy version 1.2.0
